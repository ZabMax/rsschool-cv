Short Information
I’d describe myself as a motivated, hard-working person. I pay attention to all the details of a project. I make sure that every task is just right, but is also completed in a timely manner. I’m the kind of person who takes responsibility for their actions when things go wrong. I don’t look for outside forces to blame; rather, I’m someone who looks at what I can improve upon the next time around.
